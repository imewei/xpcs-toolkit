## XPCS Theory

### Fundamental Principles

X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) is a coherent scattering technique that probes the dynamics of materials by measuring temporal fluctuations in the scattered X-ray intensity. The technique exploits the partial coherence of synchrotron X-ray beams to access timescales from microseconds to hours.

#### The Intensity Correlation Function

The central quantity in XPCS is the normalized intensity correlation function g₂(q,τ):

```
g₂(q,τ) = ⟨I(q,t)I(q,t+τ)⟩ / ⟨I(q,t)⟩²
```

Where:
- **I(q,t)**: Scattered intensity at wavevector q and time t
- **τ**: Correlation delay time (lag time)
- **⟨⟩**: Time ensemble average
- **q = 4π sin(θ/2)/λ**: Scattering wavevector magnitude

#### Connection to Sample Dynamics

Through the Siegert relation, the intensity correlation function is related to the intermediate scattering function F(q,τ):

```
g₂(q,τ) = 1 + β|f(q,τ)|²
```

Where:
- **β**: Coherence factor (0 < β ≤ 1)
- **f(q,τ) = F(q,τ)/F(q,0)**: Normalized intermediate scattering function

#### Physical Interpretation

The intermediate scattering function contains information about:

1. **Translational Dynamics**: Brownian motion, diffusion processes
2. **Rotational Dynamics**: Orientational fluctuations, tumbling motion
3. **Internal Dynamics**: Conformational changes, vibrations
4. **Collective Motion**: Hydrodynamic interactions, cooperative effects

### Dynamic Models

#### Single Exponential Relaxation

For simple diffusive motion (Brownian particles):

```
f(q,τ) = exp(-Γτ)
g₂(q,τ) = 1 + β exp(-2Γτ)
```

Where Γ = Dq² is the relaxation rate and D is the diffusion coefficient.

#### Stretched Exponential (KWW)

For systems with heterogeneous dynamics (glasses, gels):

```
f(q,τ) = exp(-(Γτ)^α)
g₂(q,τ) = 1 + β exp(-2(Γτ)^α)
```

Where α (0 < α ≤ 1) is the stretching exponent.

#### Double Exponential

For systems with two distinct timescales:

```
f(q,τ) = A₁exp(-Γ₁τ) + A₂exp(-Γ₂τ)
```

#### Power Law Relaxation

For critical fluctuations or aging systems:

```
f(q,τ) = (1 + (τ/τ₀)^α)^(-1)
```

### Q-dependence and Physical Scales

The wavevector q determines the length scale probed:

- **Length scale**: L ≈ 2π/q
- **Small q**: Large-scale collective motion
- **Large q**: Local, single-particle dynamics

#### Diffusion Coefficient Extraction

For purely diffusive systems:
```
D = Γ/q²
```

From the Stokes-Einstein relation:
```
R_h = kT/(6πηD)
```

Where R_h is the hydrodynamic radius and η is the viscosity.

## SAXS Theory

### Scattering Fundamentals

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measures elastic scattering at small angles (typically 0.1° to 10°), providing structural information about materials at the nanometer scale.

#### Basic Scattering Equation

The scattered intensity I(q) for a system of particles is:

```
I(q) = n⟨|F(q)|²⟩S(q)
```

Where:
- **n**: Number density of scatterers
- **F(q)**: Form factor (single particle scattering)
- **S(q)**: Structure factor (inter-particle correlations)
- **⟨⟩**: Average over size/shape distributions

### Form Factors

#### Spherical Particles

For spheres of radius R:

```
F(q) = 3[sin(qR) - qR cos(qR)]/(qR)³
```

#### Gaussian Chains

For flexible polymer chains:

```
F(q) = (2/x²)[x - 1 + exp(-x)]
```

Where x = q²R_g² and R_g is the radius of gyration.

#### Cylindrical Particles

For cylinders of radius R and length L:

```
F(q) = ∫₀^(π/2) [2J₁(qR sin α)/(qR sin α)]² [sin(qL cos α/2)/(qL cos α/2)]² sin α dα
```

### Structure Factors

#### Hard Sphere Interactions

The Percus-Yevick approximation gives:

```
S(q) = 1/(1 + 24φG(q)/q)
```

Where φ is the volume fraction and G(q) contains the direct correlation function.

#### Attractive Interactions

Various models exist for attractive systems:
- **Sticky hard spheres**: Short-range attractions
- **Square well potential**: Finite-range attractions
- **Yukawa potential**: Screened Coulomb interactions

### Guinier Analysis

At small q (qR_g < 1), the intensity follows:

```
I(q) = I(0) exp(-q²R_g²/3)
```

From the slope of ln[I(q)] vs q²:
```
R_g = √(3 × slope)
```

### Porod Analysis

At large q (qR >> 1), for particles with sharp interfaces:

```
I(q) = 2π(Δρ)²S/q⁴
```

Where S is the total surface area and Δρ is the scattering contrast.

### Kratky Analysis

The Kratky plot q²I(q) vs q reveals chain conformation:
- **Flexible chains**: Plateau at intermediate q
- **Rod-like structures**: Monotonic increase
- **Globular structures**: Peak followed by decay

## Multi-tau Correlation Algorithm

### Algorithm Principles

The multi-tau algorithm enables efficient computation of correlation functions over extended time ranges (6-8 decades) while maintaining statistical accuracy.

#### Logarithmic Time Sampling

The algorithm uses multiple correlator levels with increasing time spacing:
- **Level 0**: τ = δt, 2δt, 3δt, ..., 16δt
- **Level 1**: τ = 2δt, 4δt, 6δt, ..., 32δt  
- **Level 2**: τ = 4δt, 8δt, 12δt, ..., 64δt
- **Level n**: τ = 2ⁿδt, 2×2ⁿδt, 3×2ⁿδt, ..., 16×2ⁿδt

#### Statistical Efficiency

The algorithm maintains optimal statistical accuracy by:
1. **Dense sampling** at short times for precision
2. **Sparse sampling** at long times for extended range
3. **Automatic normalization** and error propagation
4. **Real-time computation** suitable for online analysis

#### Error Estimation

Statistical uncertainties are estimated using:

```
σ²[g₂(τ)] ≈ 2g₂²(τ)/N_eff(τ)
```

Where N_eff(τ) is the effective number of independent measurements at delay τ.

### Implementation Details

#### Memory Management

The multi-tau correlator uses O(log T) memory for time range T, making it suitable for long measurements.

#### Computational Complexity

The algorithm has O(log T) computational complexity per time point, enabling real-time processing.

## Analysis Methods

### Data Quality Assessment

#### Signal-to-Noise Ratio

The quality of correlation data depends on:
- **Photon statistics**: √N fluctuations limit precision
- **Detector characteristics**: Dark noise, readout noise
- **Sample stability**: Radiation damage, thermal drift
- **Beam stability**: Intensity and position fluctuations

#### Baseline Behavior

For stationary systems, g₂(τ→∞) → 1. Deviations indicate:
- **Non-ergodicity**: g₂(∞) > 1
- **Systematic drifts**: Trending baseline
- **Multiple timescales**: Incomplete relaxation

### Fitting Procedures

#### Parameter Estimation

Common fitting approaches:
1. **Least squares**: Standard χ² minimization
2. **Maximum likelihood**: Proper statistical weighting
3. **Bayesian methods**: Parameter uncertainties and correlations

#### Model Selection

Criteria for model comparison:
- **χ² goodness of fit**: Reduced chi-square near 1
- **Information criteria**: AIC, BIC for nested models
- **Residual analysis**: Random, uncorrelated residuals
- **Physical constraints**: Positive diffusion coefficients

### Advanced Analysis

#### Multi-speckle Averaging

Combining multiple detector pixels:
- **Improved statistics**: √N enhancement
- **Q-averaging effects**: Resolution considerations
- **Spatial correlations**: Pixel-to-pixel variations

#### Temperature-dependent Studies

Extracting activation energies:
```
D(T) = D₀ exp(-E_a/kT)
```

From Arrhenius plots of ln(D) vs 1/T.

#### Concentration Series

Analyzing interactions through concentration dependence:
```
D(c) = D₀(1 + k_d c + ...)
```

Where k_d is the hydrodynamic interaction parameter.

## Statistical Considerations

### Photon Counting Statistics

#### Poisson Statistics

X-ray detection follows Poisson statistics:
- **Mean intensity**: ⟨I⟩ = λ (count rate)
- **Variance**: Var(I) = λ  
- **Standard deviation**: σ = √λ

#### Correlation Function Errors

Error propagation in correlation functions:

```
σ²[g₂(τ)] = (∂g₂/∂⟨I₁⟩)²σ²[⟨I₁⟩] + (∂g₂/∂⟨I₂⟩)²σ²[⟨I₂⟩] + (∂g₂/∂⟨I₁I₂⟩)²σ²[⟨I₁I₂⟩]
```

### Systematic Effects

#### Beam Variations

Intensity fluctuations affect correlation measurements:
- **Slow drifts**: Artificial long-time correlations
- **Fast fluctuations**: Enhanced noise levels
- **Normalization**: Monitor beam corrections

#### Detector Effects

Non-idealities in detection:
- **Dead time**: High count rate corrections
- **Afterpulsing**: False correlations at short times
- **Cross-talk**: Pixel-to-pixel coupling

#### Sample Effects

Sample-related systematic errors:
- **Multiple scattering**: Distorted correlation functions
- **Heterodyne detection**: Mixed coherent/incoherent scattering
- **Flow effects**: Advective contributions to dynamics

## Experimental Design

### Beamline Requirements

#### Coherence Properties

Spatial and temporal coherence requirements:
- **Transverse coherence length**: ξ_t = λR/σ
- **Longitudinal coherence length**: ξ_l = λ²/Δλ

Where R is the source-sample distance, σ is the source size, and Δλ/λ is the bandwidth.

#### Beam Stability

Requirements for correlation measurements:
